[gothic 3](http://www.gothic3.com/), a 2006 role-playing PC game developed by [piranha bytes](https://www.igdb.com/companies/piranha-bytes), may be considered [good](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/gothic-3). this means that it contains bugs and defects, as well as advantages. i find this game very playable, so i decided to write this series of two thoughts, in which i will describe some advantages, as well as [bugs and defects]() that gothic 3 has.

gothic 3 version that i am playing: **pb/cpt/sb rvc1.6 iv1.60.29**. the lists could be updated.

## the advantages

advantages that i have decided to describe are the beautiful moments, in which i think that the gameplay suits or exceeds my needs. this includes:
- being more or less intuitive for me (it is very personal);
- being beautiful this or that way for me;
- letting me feel like a winner;
- letting me empathize with heroes and the world as a whole;
- getting close to "reality" this or that way ("reality" as reality can be understood in an RPG game).

i divided the advantages into three groups: 'gameplay', 'visual' and 'verbal'. each group consists of four aspects: 'environment', 'characters', 'hero' and all others.

### A. gameplay advantages

ENVIRONMENT|CHARACTERS|HERO
-|-|-
**ascending sounds.** specifically talks and creatures sounds.|**friend animals.** like hares ([rabbits](http://www.worldofgothic.com/gothic3/?go=g3insert_animals)?) and deers.|**the possibility to choose between good and evil.** for instance, you can kill a deer (what will possibly give you meat) or not (what will let the deer happily romping).
**sounds from cover.** specifically talks. i know somewhere is a character, even though i do not currently see it.|**my steps can wake the characters.** they wake and immediately afterwards they can go to sleep again!|**the balance between: (A) gaining the experience, (B) the number of killed characters, (C) the number of completed tasks and (D) the 'importance' of completed tasks.** By 'importance of a task' i understand how this task is important for me in the context of plots (both main plot and side plots).
**variable weather.**|**creatures sometimes attack each other.**

### B. visual advantages

ENVIRONMENT|CHARACTERS
-|-|-
**falling snow.**|**arrows poking from the characters bodies.** although it is probably only visual advantage, they probably do no additional hurt as if they dropped away.
**mist.** specifically in the morning.|
**nights.** specifically shadows from bonfire light.|

### C. verbal advantages

ENVIRONMENT|CHARACTERS|OTHER
-|-|-|-
**sounds and voices.** specifically animal sounds (like howling of wolves), snow crunching.|**sounds and voices.**|**sounds and voices.**
|||**music.** very moody. but the main things is that it excellent fits the moment in the game â€“ it changes when fight starts, it changes when fight ends, it changes when i go to the ice land, and so on.
|||**the sound of drawing a bow.** lovely! specifically lovely to hear when trying to dodge the arrow.
