title: "A thought about Gothic 3 advantages"

[Gothic 3](http://www.Gothic3.com/), a 2006 role-playing PC game developed by [Piranha Bytes](https://www.igdb.com/companies/piranha-bytes), may be considered [good](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/Gothic-3). This means that it contains bugs and defects, as well as advantages. I find this game very playable, so I decided to write this series of two thoughts, in which I will describe some advantages, as well as [bugs and defects]() that Gothic 3 has.

Gothic 3 version that I am playing: **pb/cpt/sb rvc1.6 iv1.60.29**. The lists could be updated.

## The advantages

Advantages that I have decided to describe are the beautiful moments, in which I think that the gameplay suits or exceeds my needs. This includes:
- being more or less intuitive for me (it is very personal);
- being beautiful this or that way for me;
- letting me feel like a winner;
- letting me empathize with heroes and the world as a whole;
- getting close to "reality" this or that way ("reality" as reality can be understood in an RPG game).

I have divided the advantages into three groups: "gameplay", "visual" and "audio". Each group consists of four aspects: "environment", "characters", "hero" and "all others".

### A. Gameplay advantages

#### A.I Environment

1. **Ascending sounds.** Specifically talks and creatures sounds.

2. **Sounds from cover.** Specifically talks. I know somewhere is a character, even though I do not currently see it.

3. **Variable weather.**

4. **You can pick herbs and mushrooms!**

#### A.II Characters

1. **Friend animals.** Like hares ([rabbits](http://www.worldofGothic.com/Gothic3/?go=g3insert_animals)?) and deers.

2. **My steps can wake the characters.** They wake and immediately afterwards they can go to sleep again!

3. **Creatures sometimes attack each other.**

4. **Characters react when I pull the sword out.**

5. **I can give potions to characters.**

6. **Characters are able to drink their own potions.** Certainly healing potions, but mana? And are they able to drink the potions that I have given to them?

#### A.III Hero

1. **The possibility to choose between good and evil.** For instance, you can kill a deer (what will possibly give you meat) or not (what will let the deer happily romping).

2. **The balance between: (A) gaining the experience, (B) the number of killed characters, (C) the number of completed tasks and (D) the "importance" of completed tasks.** By "importance of a task" I understand how this task is important for me in the context of plots (both main plot and side plots).

#### A.IV Other things

1. \-\-\-

### B. Visual advantages

#### A.I Environment

1. **Falling snow.**

2. **Mist.** Specifically in the morning.

3. **Nights.** Specifically shadows from bonfire light.

4. **You can saw (a log), and during this there is sawdust falling.**

5. **Colors of the world in the light of the sunset.**

#### A.II Characters

1. **Arrows poking from the characters bodies.** Although it is probably only visual advantage, they probably do no additional hurt as if they dropped away.

2. **The animation of characters during the fight.**

#### A.III Hero

1. **The animation of the nameless hero during the fight.**

#### A.IV Other things

1. \-\-\-

### C. Audio advantages

#### A.I Environment

1. **Sounds and voices.** Specifically animal sounds (like howling of wolves), snow crunching.

#### A.II Characters

1. **Sounds and voices.**

#### A.III Hero

1. \-\-\-

#### A.IV Other things

1. **Sounds and voices.**

2. **Music.** Very moody. But, the main things is that it excellent fits the moment in the game â€“ it changes when fight starts, it changes when fight ends, it changes when I go to the ice land, and so on.

3. **The sound of drawing a bow.** Lovely! Specifically lovely to hear when trying to dodge the arrow.
