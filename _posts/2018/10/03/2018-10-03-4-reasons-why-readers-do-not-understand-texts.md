In this article I will share my observations why a reader do not understand a text that they are reading (on the computer, in a paper magazine etc.).

I would like to talk about texts in general. The reasons come from my own experience on why I, myself, do not from time to time understand a text that I am reading (I read mostly on the internet).

I will try to describe texts the most generally, independently of their topics – that is, they could range from general and philosophical, like those on https://medium.com/, to specialized and technical, like those on https://developer.mozilla.org/. By a "text" I understand a blog post, a dictionary article, and all kind of text in a more or less compact form. The reasons may probably also apply to longer kinds of texts, such as books, essays and the like, maybe even poetry (maybe just in a slightly changed form).

## The reasons

### 1. There are words/terms that the reader does not know.

Possibly because of:
- **The text is written in a different language than the reader understands.**
- **Not existing words / grammatical constructions are used.** The author could make typos (also in orthography). There are also mistakes possible (I distinguish them from typos) – the author thinks that a word exists, but it does not.
- **Words/terms are used in incorrect or inappropriate meaning according to their general meanings, or to the meaning that the reader already understands.** This excludes mistakes. Now, the author of the text is understanding what they write, but they use words/terms in a different way than usual. For example, they use metaphors (common in the prose poetry). Alternatively, the reader does not encountered the words/terms in such meanings before.
- **The terms could be too specialized (or too broad) for the reader.** Consequently, the reader does not understand the subject of the text as a whole.

### 2. The reader cannot / is not able to compare the images painted by the author to what they already understand.

From my point of view, comparing is very important. Without comparing to the previous experience (known things and concepts), one cannot understand anything. Here, I have to mention a conception that I have on that (my very own): everyone creates an abstraction of the whole real world in their mind, and this is happening always, independently whether they want it or not.

Therefore, the reader may understand the text literally, each word/term separately – but without ability to compare it to something that they know (to some already created abstraction), their mind creates for it a new abstraction (probably never purely "independent", but that is not a matter of this article). Consequently, they think (say) that they "do not understand" this. (in fact, myself I cannot say whether they really "do not understand" it – they might – but that is not a matter of this article).

And why the reader cannot compare? Most probably because they have (very) different experience than the things that are described in the text. When it comes to me, this happens often when I try to learn some new field of knowledge (for now it could be how computer networks work).

I would say that this reason does not happen often to the text as a whole – rather to parts of it.

### 3. The reader lacks concentration.

Possibly because of:
- **The reader's physical/mental condition.** There could be too less oxygen in the room (if they are in a room), the reader is tired, woke up a while ago or generally does not feel good.
- **There is something that grabs the reader's attention.** A loud traffic, a loud music, their pet, partner or their own thoughts.

### 4. The reader does not want to understand the text.

This is probably the rarest reason. It could be related to concentration (see the reason about it). Possibly, the reader has different expectations of the text than the author, or they have to read it, but do not want to do it.
