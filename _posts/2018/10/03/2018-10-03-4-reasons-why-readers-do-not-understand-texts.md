in this article i will share my observations on why a reader do not understand a text that they are reading (on the computer, in a paper magazine etc.).

i would like to talk about texts in general the reasons come from my own experience on why i, myself, do not from time to time understand a text that i am reading (i read mostly on the internet).

i will try to describe texts the most generally, independently of their topics – that is, they could range from general and philosophical, like those on https://medium.com/, to specialized and technical, like those on https://developer.mozilla.org/. by a "text" i understand a blog post, a dictionary article, and all kind of text in a more or less compact form. the reasons may probably also apply to longer kinds of texts, such as books, essays and the like, maybe even poetry (maybe just in a slightly changed form).

## the reasons

### 1. there are words/terms that the reader does not know.

possibly because of:
- **the text is written in a different language than the reader understands.**
- **not existing words / grammatical constructions.** the author could make typos (also in orthography). there are also mistakes possible (i distinguish them from typos) – he/she thinks that a word exists, but it does not.
- **terms/words are used in incorrect or inappropriate meaning according to their general meanings, or to the meaning that the reader already understand.** this excludes mistakes. now, the author of the text is understanding what he/she writes, but he/she uses terms/words in a different way than usual. for example, he/she uses metaphors (common in the prose poetry). alternatively, the reader does not encountered the words/terms in such meanings before.
- **the terms could be too specialized (or too broad) for the reader.** consequently, the reader does not understand the subject of the text as a whole.

### 2. the reader cannot / is not able to compare the images painted by the author to what she/she already understands.

from my point of view, comparing is very important. without comparing to the previous experience (known things and concepts), one cannot understand anything. here, i have to mention a conception that i have on that (my very own): everyone creates an abstraction of the whole real world in his/her mind, and this is happening always, independently whether he/she wants it or not.

therefore, the reader may understand the text literally, each word/term separately – but without ability to compare it to something that he/she knows (to some already created abstraction), his/her mind creates for it a new abstraction (probably never purely "independent", but that is not a matter of this article). consequently, he/she thinks (says) that he/she "does not understand" this. (in fact, myself i cannot say whether he/she really "does not understand" it – he/she might – but that is not a matter of this article).

and why the reader cannot compare? most probably because he/she has (very) different experience than the things that are described in the text. when it comes to me, this happens often when i try to learn some new field of knowledge (for now it could be how computer networks work).

i would say that this reason does not happen often to the text as a whole – rather to parts of it.

### 3. the reader lacks concentration.

possibly because of:
- **the reader's physical/mental condition.** there could be too less oxygen in the room (if he/she is in a room), the reader is tired, woke up a while ago or does not feel good generally.
- **there is something that grabs the reader's attention.** a loud traffic, a loud music, his/her pet, partner or own thoughts.

### 4. the reader does not want to understand the text.

this is probably the rarest reason – if it exists at all. it could be related to concentration (see the reason about it). possibly, the reader has different expectations of the text than the author, or he/she has to read it, but does not want to do it.
