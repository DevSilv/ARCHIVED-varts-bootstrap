This article contains tips for bloggers that are programmers (or testers, or similar) on how to create a good article.

**You should treat the tips as my own reflections. I used only a few helping sources while writing.**

## Introduction

 I wrote this article, because I read a lot (I think so) of articles online, much of them talking about programming, code or just being more or less technical. However, I see that some of them break some rules that I would like them to hold. Consequently, I have decided to verbalize and write down these rules. I assume that they may be helpful for some of you.

In the tips, I am assuming that **you** are writing **an article**. It will always be read by some **readers**. It may contain **text** and optional **code**, **images**, **videos** and **links**. If you provide code, it means for me that you usually split it into **listings**. The article that you are writing should have **the primary subject** (== the subject), and may have some **secondary subjects**. Both you **describe** or **write about them** in the article.

Generally, it should not matter what language you use; but, if you find some contradictions, you can message me on GitHub and I consider whether these things could be improved.

**Remember, these tips may not fit all kinds of articles that you write / you want to write. If you are not familiar with some of them, you can (1) stop reading, or (2) make [an issue]([TODO]) in [this project]([TODO]) on GitHub explaining the reasons – so I could consider changing or even removing these tips.**

The tips are not written in any particular order, but I have tried to put some of the most important first.

## The tips

### 1. Write shortly.

Perhaps you read that before or someone told you. But, let us concentrate particularly on a blog's article. Readers of your article may fulfil one or more of the following conditions:
1. The language of the article is not the language that they speak natively;
2. they may want to read the article, but be tired;
3. they may **not** want to read the article, but have to for some reason.

Therefore, be conscious that:
- **When you write long sentences**, the readers might lost the context of a sentence, or even the predicate (in general it means: the verb).
- **When you write long paragraphs**, the readers might lost the context of a paragraph, the meaning of the current topic or the topic as a whole.
- **When you write long listings**, the readers might not understand what the listing does, or they might lost the way how a listing is related to the issue or subject that it illustrates (see also the tip about illustrating and describing).

Consequently, to avoid that, try to write succintly. If an issue is too complex for a short sentence, paragraph or listing, just provide more sentences, paragraphs and listings.

### 2. Do not treat superficially anything that is more advanced than basics.

When you treat something in such a way, be aware there are two cases:
- **The readers might think that they should know the described thing** – in this case, they may get confused if they do not know it.
- **The readers might think that the described thing is not important** – in this case, they may be mistaken if it is important.

### 3. Code, images, videos and links should only illustrate a subject, not describe it.

If code, images, videos or links seem to **be as important, or more important** than text, then maybe there is too little text. If code, images, videos or links seem to **describe** text, maybe you should split it into more articles.

### 4. Code, images, videos and links should be as difficult as text.

Code (or an image, a video, or a link) that is more difficult than text will make the readers **confused**; if it is easier than text, it could make the readers **wrong**.

### 5. Examples, examples, examples.

Probably you have read about it, but let me remind: the examples are those places where the readers might compare your ideas with their own, practical world. If there is available space yet (if you have a limit of words), or a description just lacks something for you – provide an example. Usually, the more examples you provide, the more the readers will understand.

### 6. Examples should speak for themselves.

If you provide examples, try to keep them accurate – and if you cannot, tell the readers about it. A poor example **with** an indication that it is poor is better than no example. And, no example is better than a poor example **without** an indication that it is poor.

### 7. Comparisons are good.

Examples are a very good way to help the readers understand the subject. But, it is also useful to compare the subject's issues or topics described in your article to the issues or topics described in other articles. They may be available on the internet, or in a printed book, or any other way that you can read them. You may assume that readers does not know them – see the tip about leaving your blog.

Usually, the comparison may be done just by providing a link or two (remember about descriptions of links), but occasionally it may be better to write about it the whole paragraph or two.

### 8. Readers should try to understand the article's subject, not the article.

Simple problems described in a complex way become complex. Always write simple, clear and short sentences, paragraphs and listings – no matter that you are either describing the basics, or an advanced topic. [Maybe Albert Einstein **did not say** "if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough"](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8742/did-einstein-say-if-you-cant-explain-it-simply-you-dont-understand-it-well-en), but personally I find this rule OK and try to achieve that level of explanation.

### 9. Reasons, reasons, reasons.

This tip is loosely related to the tip about understanding the subject: readers should understand, why something is introduced in the article. Therefore, wherever possible, explain why you wrote something. Provide reasons, causes and motives both for all of the most difficult ideas and for the simplest. If you cannot, that might mean that you should create a new article describing this thing.

### 10. Try to use phrases like "whatever the case", "it does not matter" or "you should not care" only when necessary.

All of these phrases may mean that the readers should treat the words before (or after) them as **less important** that they might have mean for them. It may cause the readers to get confused.

Generally, it may be helpful to imagine such a relationship: you **know** when to consider a term or a concept less important that it seems to be, but the readers **do not know it yet** (see also the tip about leaving your blog).

### 11. Keep YAGNI.

For those who does not know YAGNI, it is an acronym of ["You Aren't Gonna Need It"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it), a term from [extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming). It denotes that you should not introduce new functionality (e.g. to a program), until it is necessary. In the terms of blogging, it may be understood as: do not describe subjects, topics, issues, aspects, cases or even phrases that are not related somehow to the main subject. If you cannot relate something to the main subject, or even to a secondary subject, that might mean you should create a new article describing this thing.

### 12. If you describe several issues, mind the proportions.

If the article discusses several issues of the main subject, try to keep proportions in the length of their descriptions. For example, if the first and the second issue are described in one paragraph each, try to include the third and fourth in no more than three each. Otherwise, some issues may seem to be more important, just because you described them in a more extensive way.

### 13. Choose the words that you already use.

The article that you are writing is probably not a chapter of a novel. I find it better to repeat a word four times than to provide four different words instead, each describing the same concept, but having slightly different collocations or meanings. In any case, remember about readers whose native language is different from the article's language.

### 14. Be consistent when telling the readers what is right.

If the first paragraph tells the readers "You should do X", and the latter "You have to do X", they will be **confused**. In the opposite case, if firstly comes "You have to", and then "You should", they could be **mistaken**.

### 15. Do not **demand** from the readers to leave your blog.

Among other things, readers may want to leave your blog when they do not understand something or they lack of some information. Try not to demand it from them; leave it to their own decision, maybe encourage them. In order to do this, you may try to fulfil the following points:
- **Inform the readers whether the subject you describe is up-to-date**, e.g. if it is something changing fast, like a library (or even one version of it). Particularly, inform them about (1) the version that you describe, and (2) whether this version is up-to-date. Make it clear if it is not.
- **Assume that readers know only the basics**. If you have to assume that they have any advanced knowledge about the subject, then mention it in the introduction (so that anybody who do not have the proper knowledge may exit early).
- **Assume that this article is the first that the readers read on this subject.** Inform the readers whether the subject is already widely discussed (in the internet, in books and the like) and summarize it (as far as you can). If it would be too much information, provide links.

### 16. Code rarely speaks for itself. Images and videos rarely speak for themselves. Links very rarely speak for themselves.

If you do not provide a description for a thing, the readers may lost its context. Always provide an explanation for a listing, an image, a video and a link, if this listing etc. helps understand the subject. Use even a more extensive comment or caption. Generally, if it is not a description, but you used it instead of text, it probably need one.

### 17. Enumerate cautiously.

If you write "firstly", do not change the "secondly" for "next", or "later" or similar – otherwise the readers will get lost. To avoid your own mistakes and readers' misunderstanding: if it is turning out to be more than three points, enumerate them by numbers instead of words (preferably starting each from a new line).

### 18. Use phrases like "but", "however", "instead" or "although" cautiously.

If you write two expressions and join them with one of these words, readers usually expect two things at once:
1. both expressions deal with the same subject (not to be confused with the main and secondary subjects of the whole article);
2. the second expression will be in contradiction with the first.

You may write the expressions in one sentence, but you may also create two separate sentences. Whichever the case, consider that:
- if you write the first expression not **directly** after the other (i.e. you split it with another one), the readers might get confused – because they might see the contradiction weaker than you meant it to be;
- if you add a third expression **in contradiction to both or even one of them**, the readers might get confused – because they might not know what to contrapose to what.

### 19. Use phrases like "may", "might", "can", "could", "must" and "have to" cautiously.

You may see nothing wrong with these phrases, but they are often confusing in terms of technical description. I find it most useful to use them as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

_**Tip:** if you are not aware of what RFC (Request for Comments) is, see [Wikipedia's article on RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)._

### 20. Use phrases like "believe", "want to" and "seem" cautiously.

This tip is similar to the previous one: you may see nothing wrong with these phrases, but I think that they are often confusing in terms of technical description.

There are generally two "subjects" that you can relate these phrases to: (1) you and (2) other people.

If you speak about yourself, remember that the readers may believe or desire, or something may seem to them differently than you believe, desire and something seems to you.

If you speak about other people:
- **If you write "it is believed"**, you probably want to say "they say so, but I am not sure". But, be careful whether this does not start to mean "nobody is sure, but they say so".
- **If you write "somebody wanted to do something"**, you probably want to say "somebody did something". But, be careful whether this does not start to mean "somebody wanted to do something, but nobody can say whether he/she really did".
- **If you write "it seems to be"**, you probably want to say "I think it is, and you can think so, but I am not sure". But, be careful whether this does not start to mean "I think it is, but I am not sure, so you should _not_ think it is".

### 21. A note about "-" (or "–", or "—").

The characters: "-" (hypen<sup>1</sup>), "–" (en dash<sup>2</sup>) and "—" (em dash<sup>3</sup>) are commonly used (among other uses) to denote a part of a sentence which is **separated** from the rest of it. Consequently, if you write one of those character in a sentence, the readers **may presume one of two things**:
1. The current thought (or expression, or clause) is the last in the sentence (e.g. blah blah – thought.).
2. The current thought (or expression, or clause) will be followed by another same character (e.g. blah blah – thought – bla bla).

And suppose you wanted to add the second character, but forgot it somehow. So now, the readers may assume one of two things:
- The current thought (or expression, or clause) is **the last in the sentence** – and while it is not true, the readers will be mistaken.
- The current thought (or expression, or clause) is **incomplete** – which does not always mean that the readers will be mistaken, but always means that they will be confused.

_**Tip:** if you are not aware of when to use which of the aformentioned character, see this [Wikipedia's guide on hyphens and dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Hyphens_and_dashes), and also articles about [hypens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen) and [dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash)._

<sup>1</sup> For polish readers: "-" to "łącznik" lub "dywiz".

<sup>2</sup> For polish readers: "–" to "półpauza".

<sup>3</sup> For polish readers: "—" to "pauza" lub "myślnik".

### 22. Differentiate all the cases that you describe.

If a subject, an issue or a topic has several possibilities to choose from, inform the reader whether they may be considered as equivalent. If not, make it clear what are the differences and when to use which.

For example, if your article describe a new programming language, and the language has several use cases, ask yourself (and/or inform the readers) about the following things:
- How many of the use cases are you describing? (provide the highest exact number that you can)
- Are there any other use cases that you are not describing? (tell how many if you can)
- May there be any other use cases that you do not know yet about? Might there be in the past any other that you do not know yet about? May there appear new ones in the future? (tell how many if you can)
- Which of all the use cases (those described by you and those not) are similar? Which of them are different? (these are two separate questions)
- Why to choose this language in which of them?
- Even if they are different, could the language play the same role in them?
