## FAQ

### Is this a blog?

**UPDATE 2018 Dec 1:** Since my opinion has changed since the last changing of this README, now I think that this place could be called "a blog". Maybe it is the number of articles that tip the balance. Below I am leaving the original answer to this question.

    You may call this place a blog if you want to, but i do not consider it as such. I would name it "a place for my thoughts" or similar. But – I will always use terms that are usually used in the context of blogs, such as "posts" and "articles". And additionaly, I will treat it as a blog if I will be comparing it to other blogs.

### Why you do not start sentences with capital letters?

**UPDATE 2018 Dec 1:** According to [this updated post of mine](https://silvuss.github.io/2018/08/01/my-grammar-ortography-writing-style.html), this question is no longer relevant. Below I am leaving the original answer to this question.

    Here (and possibly in every GitHub project of mine), I use a convention of not using capital letters beside acronyms (e.g. MS, VCS). For more details, see [this article of mine](https://silvuss.github.io/2018/08/01/my-grammar-ortography-writing-style.html).

### I have noticed that the content of your post which I read earlier has changed. Why?

When bloggers have got some new ideas on the subject of an article they have already written and publicized, they usually have three ways to handle this:
- not to do anything (forget about their thoghts);
- write a new post (maybe somehow linked to the old one) – maybe even make a series;
- modify the old post.

I have chosen to use the last one as a main technique in my posts. But, sometimes it is useful to see the earlier version of a particular post. So, it is very helpful that GitHub (where this content is hosted) provides the functionality of looking into a file's changelog. And therefore, if you want to see it, look at the commit history of this project.
