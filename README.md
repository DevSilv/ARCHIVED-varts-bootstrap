## 1. a copyright note

note that this "silvuss-thoughts" project (this repository) has currently **no license**, as explained in [this github guide on licensing projects](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/).

for your convenience i am including below a quote from that site:

> When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.

also note that i can add a lincese in the near future if it would be relevant to the needs of this project.

## 4. FAQ

### is this a blog?

you may call this place a blog if you want to, but i do not consider it as such. i would name it "a place for my thoughts" or similar. but – i will always use terms that are usually used in the context of blogs, such as "posts" and "articles". and additionaly, i will treat it as a blog if i will be comparing it to other blogs.

### why you do not start sentences with capital letters?

here (and possibly in every github project of mine) i use a convention of not using capital letters beside acronyms (e.g. MS, VCS). for more details, see [this article of mine](https://silvuss.github.io/2018/08/01/my-grammar-ortography-writing-style.html).

### i have noticed that the content of your post which i read earlier has changed. why?

when bloggers have got some new ideas on the subject of an article they have already written and publicized, they usually have three ways to handle this:
- not to do anything (forget about their thoghts);
- write a new post (maybe somehow linked to the old one) – maybe even make a series;
- modify the old post.

**i have chosen to use the last one as a main technique in my posts.** but, sometimes it is useful to see the earlier version of a particular post. so, it is very helpful that github (where this content is hosted) provides the functionality of looking into a file's changelog. and therefore, if you want to see it, look at the commit history of this project.

### will this readme be updated?

if anything will change, i will **try to remember** to update this readme; otherwise it is not for sure.
