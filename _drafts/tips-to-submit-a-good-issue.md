in this article i would like to show you my proposition on submitting a good issue on github. it is based on a (already non-existing) page in the wiki of my project [silvuss-example-jsgame](https://github.com/silvuss/silvuss-example-jsgame).

## three disclaimers before we start

**please do note that i consider the below tips as "tips".** this article is not intended to be a manual or a guide. in case of any doubts, prior to this article one should refer to standards, manuals and official guidelines of particular websites, issue tracking systems, utilities or programs on how to write issues.

**this article is not intended to be comprehensive on any subject**, especially neither on writing nor on submitting issues. i might have forget about some important things or aspects of things, or just missed them when reading various documentations. additionally, there might be cases that i did not forget about a thing being important **objectively**, but not decided to describe it because i have not found it important **subjectively**.

lastly, **please be aware that i am not an expert in writing nor submitting issues.** i might have made typos, mistakes and errors describing the subject (although i tried not to make any).

## tips

1. it might be worth considering to use labels.
2. if you decide to use labels, it might be worth considering to follow the following rules:
    - in case you want to tell about **a bug**, use the "bug" label if something is working not you as expect it / not as specified in any document. inform what <u>happens</u>, e.g. "movings stop when clicked". just use normal sentences.
    - in case you want to tell about **an invalid behaviour/thing**, use the "invalid" label if something is working as specified in docs, but you think it should generally work differently (maybe just in the future). inform what happens and what <u>should</u> happen, e.g. "movings should not move so slow". use the words "should" and "should not", or similar.
    - in case you want to tell about **an enhancement**, use the "enhancement" label if something is working as you expect it, but could be improved anyhow. inform what <u>can</u> be made, e.g. "game dark theme". use rather nouns instead of verbs.
    - in case you want to tell about a thing that does not fit neither of the above – if you are not sure whether something could work different or better, but you want to tell about it anyway, just write about your doubts or questions.
3. in the issue description, write what you think fits best (it depends on the issue), but preferably be descriptive.
