in this article i want to show the programming and javascript aspects and ideas that i (me, silvuss) consider as key ones from 2018 on.

## FAQ before we start

### have you got some tips for using the set of questions?

 one may use this set of questions according to their needs – there is no intended use for it.

### why have you distinguished the "multi-answers questions" and "single-answer questions" groups?

the "multi-answers questions" question group means that for every question within this group one may give several different answers to this question, and they **should be treated** equally.

the "single-answer questions" question group means that for every question within this group one may give several answers, and they **may be treated** as generalizations (or specializations) of each other.

### can i add some clues to this set of questions?

yes. you can use the github's functionality (issues).

## one disclaimer before we start

**this article is not intended to be comprehensive on any subject**, especially neither on computer science, programming, programming languages, web developement, ecmascript nor javascript. i might have forget about some important things or aspects of things, or just missed them when reading various documentations. additionally, there might be cases that i am aware that a thing is important **objectively**, but i have decided not to describe it because **subjectively** i have not found it important.
